# FizzBuzz

## Usage:

All programs are run on the command line using:
```
$ ./fizzbuzz <n>
```
Where `<n>` is a number.

## Behavior

Programs should print all numbers $n \in [1,n]$ on a newline onto standard output. If $n$ is divisible by
3, print `fizz` instead. If $n$ is divisible by 5, print `buzz` instead. If $n$ is divisible by both 3 and 5
print `fizzbuzz`.
